# What is it for?

It's meant to simplify foliage placement in a natural-feeling way without having to use heighmap terrain or writing procedural placement algorithms.

It can also handle thousands of foliage instances without completely tanking the FPS (with an reasonable setup).

This is a single player plugin and works best with finite medium-sized scenes. Think platformers, shooters, adventure games, anything with a hand-made level.
